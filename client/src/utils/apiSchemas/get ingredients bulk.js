Sprinkle all sides with salt and pepper and set aside.\n\nSear roast on stovetop: When ready to cook the tenderloin roast, preheat oven to 425°F. Heat olive oil in a cast iron or thick-bottomed sauté pan that can take the heat, on high heat. When the oil is hot, place the roast in the pan and brown it on all sides, including the ends, about 10 minutes.\n\nFinish cooking in oven: When sufficiently browned, remove the roast from the pan (do not clean out the pan) and place on a roasting pan.\nPlace in the oven and roast at 425F until the internal temperature is 130°F for rare (140°F for medium), about 20 minutes (or longer if your roast wasn't at room temp to begin with. Use a meat thermometer!\n\nLet roast rest before slicing: Remove from oven and loosely tent with foil to rest for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.\n\nSauté shallots, garlic, mushrooms: While the roast is resting, prepare the mushrooms. Add 3 Tbsp of butter to the same pan you used to sear the beef roast. Heat on medium heat to melt the butter. Add the minced shallots and garlic, and cook for half a minute.\n\nStir the mushrooms into the pan and cook until they start to give off steam. Then add salt, pepper, and herbs de provence. Continue to cook until just cooked through.\nAdd a few tablespoons of warm water to the pan to scrape up any remnants from the bottom of the pan (can also use white wine or marsala). Remove from heat.\n\nSlice the roast: Use a sharp knife to slice the roast across the grain into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve with the sautéed mushrooms.",

Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. You could try Black River Winery Merlot. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 10 dollars per bottle.",

Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Ghost Pines Napa County Sonoma County Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.",

In addition to these flavors, you'll taste hints of cigar paper, cocoa, caramel and nutmeg wrapped around a remarkably smooth mid-palate full of velvety texture and depth. On the long finish, you'll find suggestions of toasty oak, mouth-filling black fruit, and cola framed by plush tannins.",

Heat the oil in a pan big enough to hold the beef, and brown the beef all over, seasoning with salt. In a roasting tin, use the onions as a bed to sit the beef on  pat on any spices that have fallen off. Roast for 20 mins for rare, 25 mins for medium, and 35 mins for well-done beef.\nLift the beef from the tin and rest on a platter, covered with foil to keep it hot, for about 30 mins. Set the tin with the onions and roasting juices over the hob and stir in the oil, cornflour and crumbled stock cubes. Mix in the jelly, then gradually stir in the wine and 400ml boiling water, scraping up any stuck bits from the bottom. Simmer for 15 mins until reduced a little. Season, then sieve into a clean pan to keep warm, discarding the onions. Slice the beef, scatter over the thyme, if you like, and serve with the gravy.",

(You can let it rest on a sheet of aluminum foil, on a baking sheet.)\n\nCombine salt, pepper, and minced rosemary in a small bowl.\n\nMake small incisions with a knife, just big enough to fit slivers of garlic into it. Slice garlic cloves into 2 or 3 slices and fit a slice of garlic into each cut. (Try to keep the cuts spread even throughout the surface of the meat so the flavor infuses evenly.) \n\nGenerously season the meat with salt/pepper/rosemary all around. Make sure to cover all the sides. \n\nCooking the roast:\n\nPreheat the oven to 325° and line a roasting pan with aluminum foil to catch the drippings.\n\nPreheat a skillet over medium-high heat and add a little oil. Sear the meat until golden brown on all sides. (About a minute per side.)\n\nTransfer the roast onto the rack in the roasting pan and insert a leave-in thermometer into the center. (If you don’t have a leave-in thermometer, you will need to take the meat out of the oven to take the temperature.)\n\nCook until internal temperature reaches 130°-135° for medium-rare. Remember that meat continues to cook a few degrees as it rests. (Cook to 140°-145° for medium.)\n\nTake the meat out of the oven and onto a rimmed cutting board. Tent with a sheet of aluminum foil and let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.\n\nCutting the roast:\n\n(You can place the cutting board in side a rimmed baking sheet to catch the juices.)\n\nAfter the meat had time to rest, use a sharp knife to slice roast beef thinly, against the grain.",

Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Director's Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.",

Juicy upon entry, the wine broadens and becomes velvety on the palate with flavors of plum, loganberry and black cherry accentuated by subtle spice notes of espresso bean and toasted vanilla. Medium tannins support the body of this wine, offering sophistication in its finish. Pairs nicely with brisket, grilled pork chops and linguine with pesto.",

Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The Ghost Pines Napa County Sonoma County Merlot with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 27 dollars per bottle.",

In addition to these flavors, you'll taste hints of cigar paper, cocoa, caramel and nutmeg wrapped around a remarkably smooth mid-palate full of velvety texture and depth. On the long finish, you'll find suggestions of toasty oak, mouth-filling black fruit, and cola framed by plush tannins.",
